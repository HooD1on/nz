            <p className="testimonial-text">I recently booked a trip to Italy with VacaSky, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. From the initial consultation to the post-trip follow-up, everything was handled with great care. The team was incredibly responsive and helpful, making sure all my concerns were addressed. The accommodations were perfect, and the itinerary was expertly crafted. I would highly recommend VacaSky to anyone looking for a stress-free and unforgettable travel experience.</p>
